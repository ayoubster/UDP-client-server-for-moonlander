How to run the HSS:

1. Make sure you’re running a WSL or on Ubuntu, as the ./simulator file is a 64-bit executable intended to run on linux
2. Make sure your linux terminal has python 3.10.4 installed (other versions will probably work)
3. Open two terminals, enter the directory with the ‘cd (directory)’ command, and ‘ls’ to list the folders in that directory. 
4. Open the ‘build’ folder, and run the ./simulator file in one terminal, and the hss.py file in another.

If the 'build' folder is on your desktop..
E.g ‘cd Desktop’ → ‘cd build’ → ‘python3 hss.py’ (in terminal 1) → ‘./simulator’ (in terminal 2)
